# Sample Data Directory

This directory contains sample files for testing the tutorial notebooks.

## Contents

The notebooks will download or generate test data as needed:
- Sample images for computer vision tasks
- Sample audio files for speech recognition
- Sample text files for NLP tasks

## Note

Most notebooks use built-in test data or download samples automatically. You can add your own test files here to experiment with the models.

### Recommended Test Files

**For Image Tasks** (notebooks 04, 05, 06, 09):
- Place `.jpg`, `.png` images here
- Try images of different subjects: objects, scenes, text documents

**For Audio Tasks** (notebooks 07, 08):
- Place `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac` audio files here
- Speech recordings work best for ASR tasks

**For Text Tasks** (notebooks 01, 02, 03):
- Place `.txt` files here
- Any text content works for testing
